# HTMX-Django-Experiments
 Playing with HTMX features on a basic Django web app

 Will use Alpine.js (or try out hyperscript) where it is helpful, and Tailwind for styling 

 May incorporate the django-htmx package at some point

 DEMOS:
 - CRUD - experimenting with CRUD behaviours, without full page reload
    - Click to edit, live Add & (to come) Delete 

OTHER IDEAS:
 - the live markdown editor & viewer from django-htmx site 
 - need landing page to direct to various apps
