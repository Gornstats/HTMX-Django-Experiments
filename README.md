# HTMX-Django-Experiments
 Playing with HTMX features on a basic Django web app

 Will use Alpine.js (or try out hyperscript) where it is helpful, and Tailwind for styling 

 May incorporate the django-htmx package at some point

 DEMOS:
 - CRUD - experimenting with CRUD behaviours, without full page reload
